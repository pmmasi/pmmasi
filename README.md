### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Pedro Masi, welcome to my content page!

I'm a young professional passionate about solving applied business problems at the intersection of finance, economics and machine learning. I am motivated to collaborate on open source projects as well as applied case studies where I could contribute to optimize business decisions using innovative methodologies including causal econometrics, forecasting, NLP, deep learning, statistical learning, and others.

I'm currently pursuing a challenging PhD program in Business Analytics and Statistics at the Haslam College of Business, University of Tennessee. This program trains students in novel methodological approaches to solving applied problems. Courses taken include Applied Optimization Techniques, Mathematical Economics, Machine Learning, Text Mining, Design of Experiments, Econometrics, Deep Learning, Microeconomic Theory.

In the past, I held financial consultant positions at Rabobank, Climate Bonds, University of Nebraska Lincoln and Stone X. I enjoyed these experiences at the fullest and decided to pursue a degree in academia where I can make use of my business saviness along with novel statistical methodologies highly demanded in today's world.

In my free time I volunteer at kids' afterschool programs, helping them with their homework assignments, or teaching them how to code using microbit. I also enjoy travelling, playing soccer, hicking and running.

Feel free to reach out to collaborate for either research or applied business problems.
